## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about client side form validation, i probably know that it is just the tip of iceberg when it comes to form validation.

```js
const emailRegExp =
  /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, i will dive more in form validation.

### Useful resources

- [Regex pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This is a really common useful form validator pattern that I find very handy from time to time from mozilla MDN docs.
